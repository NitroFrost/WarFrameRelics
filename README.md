# WarFrameRelics
Repo for WarFrameRelics

**Created by: NitroFrost**
**Version number 1.01**


This program is meant for void relic runs

The directory path should point to Relics. You can change the name or make a new document you just need to make sure it's formated corrected according to the standard in Relics.

For any vaulted items in a relics loot pool you will see a '**' before and after the name. This indicates that the loot is vaulted.

if you with to use the 'Ignore owned items?' checkbox you will need to go through the Relics txt file (or the text file you created) and put a '@' in front of the pieces name
> EX. @Braton Prime Barrel
> EX. @**Vectis Prime Blueprint**

The program will not run if you don't have a directory selected.

You also need to select a dropdown menu item. These items are the 4 relics currently in the game.

After selecting a relic from the drop down list then you will need to type in the relics code in the P1-P4 boxs (P1 = Player 1)
> You do not need all 4 boxes filled and you can do them out of order. I labled them p1 etc because of player 1 in the relic run etc. 

After you have all the information typed in (not case sensitive) proceed to click on run

You should now see a populated list of relics with indicaters if you own them or not as well as if they are vaulted.
